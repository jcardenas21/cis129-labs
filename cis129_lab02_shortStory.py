# Prints a short story about an Oak Tree
print('Lena had always feared the old oak tree at the edge of the farm, its gnarled branches twisting like grasping fingers.')
print('One stormy night, lightning split the tree in half, revealing a rusted metal box buried in its hollow trunk.')
print('Inside, she found letters from a century ago—written by a woman with her exact name, warning of a great misfortune that would befall their family.')
print('As the wind howled outside, Lena realized the final letter’s date matched tomorrow’s. Heart pounding, she braced herself for whatever fate had in store.')
